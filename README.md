HoloFi Rubyx Encoder is a web-based tool that converts Solidity code into Lua code using the NBH algorithm. This tool is designed to aid developers working with quantum computing and decentralized finance (DeFi) by providing a streamlined way to transform Ethereum smart contract code (Solidity) into Lua scripts.

## Features

- **Solidity to Lua Conversion:** Convert Solidity code into Lua using the NBH algorithm.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for easy code conversion.
- **Quantum Computing Integration:** Leverage quantum computing for efficient and secure operations.
- **Complete Anonymity:** Ensures user anonymity during the conversion process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the HoloFi Rubyx Encoder, you need:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holofi-rubyx-encoder.git
   cd holofi-rubyx-encoder
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file:**

   Simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.

### Usage

1. **Input Solidity Code:**
   - Open the web page.
   - Enter your Solidity code in the provided text area.

2. **Convert the Code:**
   - Click the "Convert" button.
   - The converted Lua code will be displayed in the output section.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - If the input field is empty, an error message will prompt you to enter Solidity code.
   - Any errors during the conversion process will be displayed in the error message section.

### Example

Here's a quick example to demonstrate the usage:

1. **Input Solidity Code:**
   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   contract Example {
       uint256 public value;

       function setValue(uint256 _value) public {
           value = _value;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Converted Lua Code:**
   ```lua
   -- Converted with NBH Algorithm
   nbh_function Example()
       -- Lua code
       nbh_integer256 value

       nbh_function setValue(nbh_integer256 _value) -- Lua code
           value = _value
       nbh_end
   nbh_end
   ```

## Technical Details

### HTML

The interface is built using basic HTML, styled with CSS, and includes a JavaScript script for handling the conversion logic.

### CSS

The page is styled with a black background and a blue and yellow color scheme for better readability and aesthetics.

### JavaScript

The conversion logic is handled by JavaScript, utilizing the NBH algorithm to transform Solidity code into Lua. The `convertWithNBH` function performs the conversion, and the `applyNBHAlgorithm` function refines the Lua code according to the NBH specifications.

### Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and layout.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for handling the conversion logic.
